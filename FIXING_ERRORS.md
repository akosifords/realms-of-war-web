# Fixing TypeScript Errors

This project has several compatibility issues that need to be fixed before running. Follow these steps to resolve them:

## Step 1: Install Compatible Dependencies

Run the install-deps.bat script or install dependencies manually with specific versions:

```bash
npm install --save react@18.2.0 react-dom@18.2.0 react-router-dom@6.11.2 firebase@9.22.0
npm install --save-dev typescript@4.9.5 @types/react@18.0.28 @types/react-dom@18.0.11 @types/node@16.18.12
npm install --save react-scripts@5.0.1
```

## Step 2: Version Compatibility Issues

The project initially had conflicting versions:
- React 18.3.1 with React-Scripts 3.0.1 (incompatible)
- @types/react 19.0.11 with React 18.3.1 (mismatched)
- Firebase 11.4.0 (too new for the code)

These have been fixed in the updated package.json.

## Step 3: TypeScript Configuration

The tsconfig.json file has been updated to use:
- `"jsx": "react-jsx"` instead of `"jsx": "preserve"`
- `"noImplicitAny": false` remains to suppress TypeScript errors

## Step 4: Type Declarations

The project includes custom type declarations for:
- Firebase (`src/firebase/firebase.d.ts`)
- React JSX (`src/react-app-env.d.ts`)

## Step 5: Start the Development Server

After completing the above steps, clean the node_modules folder and reinstall:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
rm -f package-lock.json
npm install
npm start
```

## Common Errors and Solutions

1. **Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'react'**
   - This typically means the React installation is corrupted
   - Verify the node_modules folder includes a react folder

2. **JSX errors**
   - Make sure the tsconfig.json has `"jsx": "react-jsx"`
   - React and ReactDOM versions should match (both 18.2.0)

3. **Firebase version issues**
   - If you see Firebase API errors, the versions might still be mismatched
   - Check for breaking changes in Firebase documentation

4. **"This version of React-DOM is not compatible with the version of React"**
   - Make sure both React and React-DOM are the same version (18.2.0)
